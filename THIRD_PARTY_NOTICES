Summary of changes:
  - Test cases were extracted and rewritten to use RAGE's test_framework
    (test/expect pattern) instead of CPython's unittest infrastructure.
  - Tests were simplified or trimmed to match the subset of Python semantics
    that RAGE implements (e.g., int64 range limitations).
  - Some tests were reorganized by topic across multiple files.
